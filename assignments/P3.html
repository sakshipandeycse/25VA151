            <h2>Summary of Operation Sindoor</h2>
            <p><strong>üóìÔ∏è</strong>May 10, 2025</p>

                alt="Abstract image representing Operation Sindoor">

            <p>India‚Äôs strategic calculus in Operation Sindoor was informed by an unwavering objective: to uphold national sovereignty and protect civilian lives without precipitating a broader military conflagration. By confining military action to terrorist infrastructure, India underscored its non-escalatory posture and respect for established international norms. Pakistan‚Äôs reputation as the epicentre of global terrorism is rooted in a number of instances, there are several terrorist attacks around the world where Pakistani fingerprints have been found. Earlier in pursuit of justice for the victims of terrorist attack be it Mumbai in 2008, Pathankot in 2016, Pulwama in 2019 or many others, India provided forensic evidence and urged Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of these attacks to justice.  India has also submitted an updated dossier to the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee, documenting Pakistan‚Äôs complicity in sheltering and abetting designated terrorist operatives.
Meanwhile, Pakistan‚Äôs repeated stone-walling of joint investigative teams despite India‚Äôs full cooperation in forensic, call-data and on-site evidence sharing for Mumbai‚ÄØ2008 and Pathankot‚ÄØ2016 probes reveals that its calls for new ‚Äújoint investigations‚Äù are nothing more than delaying tactics. In these circumstances, India has also placed the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance: demographic changes, evolving climate realities and several such factors have led to fundamental changes in the circumstances in which the treaty was concluded.  Constant refusal of Pakistan for Government to Government negotiations to discuss the modifications is itself a ‚ÄòViolation of the Treaty‚Äô and a breach of its spirit of ‚Äúgoodwill and friendship‚Äù.
Operation Sindoor is a principle-driven military response underpinned by strategic restraint.  It was in response to a barbaric terrorist attack on innocent tourists which originated from Pakistan. India had a right to response which it did, in a responsible, restrained, measured and a non-escalatory manner.</p>

            <p>Operation Sindoor showcased India‚Äôs firm yet restrained response to cross-border terrorism. It upheld national sovereignty and protected civilians while avoiding wider conflict. By targeting only terrorist infrastructure, India demonstrated responsibility and adherence to international norms. The operation sent a clear message that India values peace but will act decisively against terrorism and aggression.</p>
